# weather_app
Week 6 challenge: 

This week my challenge was to creat a weather app based on the following criteria.


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


The best I could do at this time was to create a spot to store the input data but I couldn't figure out how to display it as a linked button. However, when searching for any city you can pull the current weather conditions and the 5 day forecast.
